# InterviewBit Solutions

This repo is a collection of my solutions to InterviewBit Problems. These solutions are in Ruby. Since not all problems have Ruby as the available choice of language to solve the problem, you might find some questions missing here. 
Secondly, these codes are snippets. You will need to have a wrapper class to run the program or you can test them in InterviewBit.

Feel free to contribute and suggest alternatives primarily
1. If your solution is asymptotically faster
2. Same time complexity but with shorter/cleaner code
